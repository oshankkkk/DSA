# Recursive soloution 
Okay so this question is like the febenoacci, and like most other dynamic programming questions.
The problem is just small problems gotten together or like it can be divided into subproblems.
Like if you look into it when you are given lets say 5 squares like the fibonnacci sequence, this can be broken into a tree of steps ryt. 
When rou check how many ways to climb 5 stares, you gotta see if how many ways you can climb 1 stair or 2 stair and after that the number of stairs is just a number.
Like when you are given a problem you can see " ahh we can simplify this problem into smaller parts, kinda like  how you do it in math yk when you are given 1500/25 you instatly get the feeliing oh this is like that, same here"
Thats the goal of practising, to make every problem pattern fermuler as you can so when you see the porblem you can link it to other problem youve done and conncet the dots.

Now imma figure out the time/space complexity of this
So the time complexity is 2^n expoential and the space complexity is the height(idk why gotta check that out) so thats just n 
now i gota memoise this
