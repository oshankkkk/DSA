# Perfect Square
## What went wrong
so the perfect square problem i found out the base case but i my answer was wrong.
the fault was not running the question in my head and what i did was i switched the returning value with the count  k
like even tho i understand the base case i didnt get the whole question implementation.
## Lesson learned
-question can have the same base case with different meanings and will change how the answer is implemented.

Base case was wrong
## Lesson learned
Unless specified the question at least needs 1 value thats asked to succeed in basecase

# Robber House

## Things learned
Used stuff i learned from the 1st 2 questions and dealt with the edge cases
