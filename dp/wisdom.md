# Perfect Square
## What went wrong
so the perfect square problem i found out the base case but i my answer was wrong.
the fault was not running the question in my head and what i did was i switched the returning value with the count  k
like even tho i understand the base case i didnt get the whole question implementation.
## Lesson learned
-question can have the same base case with different meanings and will change how the answer is implemented.
# Min climbingstairs
## What went wrong
Base case was wrong
## Lesson learned
Unless specified the question at least needs 1 value thats asked to succeed in basecase
# Robber House
## success!!
## Things learned
Used stuff i learned from the 1st 2 questions and dealt with the edge cases
### I NEED TO CHANGE THE WAY I LEETCODE AND HAVE A PLAN 
# Decode Msg
## What went wrong
everything 
## Lessons Learned 
we can either start with zero and built up or start with the length of the list and break down.
its just that we should always follow what the problem has or it will get messier 
recursion can be coded like fiboncacci or like one function call after another 
# Travel Ticket
## What went wrong
for somereason i build the solution in a iterative way and couldnt find why it didnt work 
## What i learned
always go recursive at 1st, brute force its bout trying all the solutions straight up 
# Unique Paths
## Already done this so its fine
