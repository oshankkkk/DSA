## What went wrong
so the perfect square problem i found out the base case but i my answer was wrong.
the fault was not running the question in my head and what i did was i switched the returning value with the count  k
like even tho i understand the base case i didnt get the whole question implementation.
## Lesson learned
-question can have the same base case with different meanings and will change how the answer is implemented.
